# ðŸ’ª Fitness - Analyze and prepare an action plan for customer retention

The network of fitness centers "Bodybuilder-Datascientist" develops a strategy of interaction with clients based on analytical data.

A common problem in fitness clubs and other services is customer churn. How to understand that the client is no longer with you? You can write in the outflow of those who asked to close the contract or deleted the account. However, customers do not always leave ostentatiously: more often they stop using the service quietly.

Churn indicators are industry specific. When a user rarely but steadily purchases from an online store, it does not seem that he "fell off". But if two weeks does not go to the channel with daily updated content, things are bad: the subscriber is bored and seems to have left you.

For a fitness center, we can assume that a customer is in a churn if they have never visited a gym in the last month. Of course, it is possible that he left for Bali and upon arrival will definitely continue to go to fitness. However, more often it is the other way around. If a client started a new life on Monday, went to the gym a little, and then disappeared - most likely, he will not return.

To combat churn, the customer service department of the "Bodybuilder-Datascientist" has converted many client profiles into electronic form. The task is to analyze and prepare an action plan for customer retention.
