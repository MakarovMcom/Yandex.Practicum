# üïπÔ∏è Games - Development of a monetization model for a game

Develop a monetization model for a gaming application.
Many games make money through advertising. And they all face a contradiction:

- The user will get angry and leave if you start showing him ads before the game pulls him in.
- But the later the creators of the game turn on ads, the less they will earn.

The aim is to help the business choose the best time to launch an ad, calculate its payback in different scenarios.
Creators of the game are planning to show it on the screen by choosing a building.
