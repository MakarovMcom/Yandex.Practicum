# 🍔 Mobile App - Needed to figure out how the users are behaving

### Main questions from the users:

- Explore the sales funnel. Find out how users arrive at a purchase. 
- How many users make it to the purchase, and how many get stuck in the previous steps? Which ones?

- Examine the results of the A / A / B experiment: 
> The designers wanted to change the fonts throughout the application, and the managers were afraid that the users would be unusual. We agreed to make a decision based on the results of the A / A / B test. The users were divided into 3 groups: 2 control groups with old fonts and one experimental group with new ones. Find out which font is best.

### Result:
