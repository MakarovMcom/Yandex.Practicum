 Here I'm adding projects which have been made by me during my education course in Yandex.Practicum. 
 Link for the platform https://praktikum.yandex.ru/data-analyst/
 Mostly I was using Jupiter Notebook to make them suitable for reading.

 Structure:

 1. Customer's Reliability Project
 Topic: data processing
 Task: to figure out whether the marital status and the number of the client's children affect the fact that the loan is repaid on time
 Tools: Python + Pandas library; Jupiter Notebook
 Results: was made a picture of the most reliable borrower for the loans
 
 2. Real Estate Market Project
 Topic: exploratory data analysis
 Task: figure out whether the marital status and the number of the client's children affect the fact that the loan is repaid on time
 Tools: Python + Pandas library, Jupiter Notebook
 Results: descriptive client model will be used in the building a credit scoring model  
 
 3. Telecom Project
 Topic: statistical data analysis
 Task: determine the promising tariff for a mobile operator
 Tools: Python + Pandas & Matplotlib libraries, Jupiter Notebook
 Results: were tested several hypothesis (T-Test); deficiencies in tariffs were found, and made recommendations for their improvement 
 
 4. Game Project
 Topic: mixed
 Task: identify patterns that determine the success of the game
 Tools: Python + Pandas & Matplotlib libraries, Jupiter Notebook
 Results: were tested several hypothesis (T-Test); conclusions were prepared which game directions should be developed in the near future
 
 5. Airline Project 
 Topic: Data Storage
 Task: understand the preferences of users who buy tickets to certain destinations
 Tools: Python + Pandas, Matplotlib & BeautifulSoup libraries; JSON Requests; Jupiter Notebook; PostgreSQL
 Results: the demand of passengers for air tickets was analyzed, client's preferences were found
 
 6. Afisha Project 
 Topic: business performance analysis, cohort analysis, user metrics
 Task: reduce costs by eliminating unprofitable traffic sources and reallocating budget
 Tools: Python + Pandas, Numpy & Matplotlib, Seaborn libraries; Jupiter Notebook 
 Results: user metrics for the product were calculated; the best channels for attracting traffic were determined
 
 7. E-commerce Project
 Topic: A/B testing
 Task: launch A/B test and prioritize hypotheses
 Tools: Python + Pandas, Numpy, Scipy & Matplotlib, Seaborn libraries; Jupiter Notebook
 Results: were tested several hypothesis (U-Test); the test was declared as invalid
 
 8. Ð¡atering establishments project
 Topic: data visualisation 
 Task: market analysis
 Tools: Python + Pandas, Numpy, Scipy & Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly libraries; Jupiter Notebook; API; JSON Requests;
 Results: were made recommendations for the new restaurant development
 
 9. Mobile App Project
 Topic: mixed
 Task: build a sales funnel, study customer behavior, explore the results of an A/A/B tests
 Tools: Python + Pandas, Numpy, Scipy & Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly libraries; Jupiter Notebook; 
 Results: were tested 16 hypothesis (Z-Test); A/B test showed that changes in the interface did not give significant results for users; were given recommendations for App improvement
 
 10. News Project
 Topic: dashboards creation
